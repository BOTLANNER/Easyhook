	Known Issues
===============================


Unable to use CLRAssemblyReferenceList
-> http://www.ikriv.com/blog/?p=16
	"if you return a non-null value from IHostAssemblyManager::GetNonHostStoreAssemblies,
	 then ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInDefaultAppDomain returns error code 0×80131051 or FUSION_E_LOADFROM_BLOCKED,
	 without ever consulting your assembly store, or the non-host store assemblies list."
	
	
Unable to get the array of RhAssemblyInfo's from host process to target process.
-> As a temporary workaround the CompleteManagedInjection method in entry.cpp needs to be adapted
   so InInfo->Assemblies and InInfo->AssembliesCount is adapted to match the target application during testing.


AssemblyStore::ProvideAssembly method
-> .NET CLR Host seems to be unable to use the resulting IStream
-> The IStream instances are created using the SHCreateStreamOnFileEx method
-> Reading the assembly to memory and creating an IStream for that memory block doesn't fix the problem
